<h1>Block Game</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Note: The OCD (Obsessive Camera Direction) library is required by this project. Please download it from <a href = "http://gdsstudios.com/processing/libraries/ocd/"> here </a>. </p>
<p>This is a 3D survival FPS game set in the space of a cuboid. The player aims and shoots based on the position of the crosshair, which is determined by mouse movement and position. There are two types of enemies: moving and shooting. Moving enemies spawn far from the player and move towards the player. Shooting enemies are stationary at the edges of the space and shoot bullets at the player.</p>
<p>The player has attributes of health and score. Different values are added to the score when the player shoots an enemy. 3 is subtracted from the score for every bullet shot. Collisions between moving enemies and the player and collisions between the shooting enemies' bullets and the player cause health to decrease. However, health increases every time the draw runs.</p>
<p>When the player's bullet hits an enemy, the enemy disappears and another one is added. The goal of the game is to amass the highest score possible. Try to kill all enemies as soon as possible. Shoot accurately. Survive.
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Initially, I planned on making a 3D solar system model with surface explorations, but soon realised that it was unfeasible since it would probably require mapping out planetary surfaces. Hence, I thought of building on my previous project and trying out a new camera library. Hence, I decided to make an FPS as I working towards making a zombie survival FPS inside a maze.</p>
